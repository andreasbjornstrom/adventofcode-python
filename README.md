# Advent of Code solutions

This project holds my solutions + utilities for **[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)** puzzles over the years.

To run solutions and utilities, first you must install dependencies. I highly recommend using a virtual environment for this. I've been using `pipenv` for that lately.
```sh
pipenv install
```
Once that's done, you can run solutions like so:
```sh
python -m adventofcode run [-y <year>] <day>
```

If you like the setup I've got here, feel free to use it yourself. Or let me know if it's garbage! This is my first time making a proper Python project from scratch, so I'm sure it's not perfect. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
